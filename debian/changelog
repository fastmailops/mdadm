mdadm (2.5.2-10) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Added README.checkarray with some information about the check process.
  * Applied patch by upstream to fix the logic of the --run switch (see
    #287415). Thus also reverted the mdadm-raid hack used to fix the bug in
    the 2.5.2-9 upload.
  * Recognise devfs-style device nodes by fixing a regression bug in the root
    RAID autodetection code (closes: #381007), which was introduced as part of
    the fix for #380596 in the 2.5.2-9 upload. The bug is RC, but it only
    applies to unstable right now, so I am not pumping up the urgency.
    The autodetection code now doesn't care about the actual name of the array
    device, but instead only insists that it exists, is a block device, and
    recognised as an array by mdadm (mdadm --detail).
  * checkarray: correctly recognise when the kernel is too old for parity
    checks, or when there are no redundant arrays present.
  * mkconf: now also outputs MAILADDR.

mdadm (2.5.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added logcheck rules for kernel messages generated by checkarray, using
    logcheck server level.
  * Added handling of partitionable arrays to root RAID autodetection script
    (closes: #380596).
  * Forcing RAID assembly to run the arrays, working around an upstream bug
    until that's fixed (closes: #287415).
  * Updated documentation in README.initramfs-transition to include
    information related to #380089.
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - Vietnamese by Clytie Syddall, thanks!

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Jul 2006 14:35:38 +0100

mdadm (2.5.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-added rootraiddoc.97.html which was mysteriously lost (closes: #378678).
  * Catching modprobe error in case of absence of the kernel modules, or
    a non-modular kernel. Thanks to Holger Levsen.
  * Copy raid456 kernel module into initramfs, if present (closes: #380152).
  * checkarray: check for presence of active RAID arrays and give an
    appropriate error if there are none present (closes: #379019).
  * checkarray: skip sync for non-redundant devices (closes: #379352, #380424).
  * Fixing cron registration for checkarray. crontab(5) is really stupid and
    makes me think that they simply documented a bug instead of fixing it, so
    now I have to hack around it. See the cron.d file (closes: #380425).
  * Removed the code writing auto-detected devices to /var, which was silly
    since /var isn't necessarily mounted yet by the time mdadm-raid is called.
    Thanks to Maurizio Avogadro for pointing this out.
  * Add reference to BAARF to README.Debian and included the RAID5 vs RAID10
    article from the BAARF website.
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - Japanese by Hideki Yamane, thanks!
    - French by Florentin Duneau, thanks! (closes: #379511)

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Jul 2006 22:49:32 +0100

mdadm (2.5.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release to unstable.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Jul 2006 17:23:23 +0100

mdadm (2.5.2-6) experimental; urgency=low

  * Adding mdrun to generated udeb. I will only remove mdrun after etch.
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - Dutch, thanks to Frans "Franzerl" Pop! (closes: #377412)
    - French, thanks to Florentin Duneau! (closes: #377968)

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Jul 2006 23:11:24 +0200

mdadm (2.5.2-5) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Remove the check for the lvm prereq in the initramfs hook, as #369617 is
    now fixed. Thus conflicts against initramfs-tools (<< 0.65).
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - German, thanks to Mario JouÃŸen!
  * Added short note about maintenance in SVN to README.Debian.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Jul 2006 23:10:36 +0200

mdadm (2.5.2-4) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * The "it takes two to swing" release.
  * Now does not stop arrays on upgrade or remove. Thanks (and sorry) to
    Christian Pernegger (and hopefully no others).
  * Fixed small problem in debconf configuration script related to unbound
    MAIL_TO variable. Thanks to Christian Pernegger.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Fri,  7 Jul 2006 16:59:01 +0200

mdadm (2.5.2-3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * The initramfs now gets all RAID modules installed. It's a lot safer to
    have them all around, the size difference is negligible, and we still only
    load the needed ones at boot time.
  * Added /usr/share/mdadm/checkarray, which can be used to check arrays for
    parity. Also added a debconf question to let the user choose whether
    cron should run these checks (closes: #377071).
  * Only shut down arrays automatically when they've been automatically
    started (closes: #376009).
  * Make sure the user has a chance to choose the autostart feature by
    elevating the debconf priority to high (see #376009). The warning about
    reuse of RAID components has also been elevated to debconf priority high.
  * The MAIL_TO setting from /etc/default/mdadm has been removed. Instead, use
    MAILADDR in /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf. See mdadm.conf(5). Your setting should
    be automatically migrated.
  * Now rewrites /etc/default/mdadm (but preserves settings) instead of trying
    to patch it with changes.
  * Added note to README.Debian to ensure users know that only the devices
    listed in mdadm.conf will be autostarted (see #376009).
  * Now includes latest md.txt from kernel documentation in
    /usr/share/doc/mdadm/md.txt.gz.
  * Added some more recipes to /usr/share/doc/mdadm/README.recipes.gz.
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - Swedish, thanks to Daniel Nylander!
    - Brazilian Portuguese, thanks to Felipe Augusto van de Wiel!
    - Czech, thanks to Miroslav Kure!
    - Russian, thanks to Yuri Kozlov (closes: #376181).
  * Further updates to the debconf templates; I hope the translators aren't
    going to kill me.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Fri,  7 Jul 2006 15:09:40 +0200

mdadm (2.5.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "if it weren't for Munich's wheat beer, there'd be no" release.
  * Removed -fno-strict-aliasing from compiler options, after upstream fixed
    the bug that led to its use (see #369779, #356153). Thanks to Elimar
    Riesebieter for pointing this out (closes: #375876).
  * Moved detection of RAID devices from initramfs hook to debconf control
    file, and added a (low-priority) debconf question as to which devices
    should be started early in the boot sequence. For the cases where we
    failed to auto-detect previously (e.g. root on LVM on RAID), it's paranoid
    and suggests to start them all (closes: #375879). Thanks to Alec Berryman
    for spotting this.
  * Fixed a typo in README.experimental, which could lead to an unbootable
    system with initramfs-tools 0.64 or before. Again, thanks to Alec for
    spotting this.
  * Extended bug script to include --examine output for all components (at
    least if called by root, which hopefully should never happen. Err,
    wait...)
  * Disabled deprecation warning in mdrun until the transition is complete.
  * Reworded the debconf templates due to a new question, and also for
    readability.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Jun 2006 22:54:47 +0200

mdadm (2.5.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Implemented checks in the initramfs hooks and scripts for compatibility
    with initramfs-tools. Now we do not need a conflict anymore because
    mdadm's hooks and scripts will simply do nothing while the ones provided
    by initramfs-tools are still present.
  * Not using /bin/bash for mdrun, which I thought we'd need for read timeout
    support (for the deprecation warning). Since the -n and -t flags to the
    read shell builtin are non-POSIX, I dropped them, they were merely
    cosmetic anyway.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Jun 2006 15:06:55 +0200

mdadm (2.5.1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Updating dependency on initramfs-tools, which has not yet adopted to mdadm
    taking over the hooks.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Jun 2006 22:35:08 +0200

mdadm (2.5.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Really fixes return status of examine (closes: #367901).
    - Fixes a memory leak in monitor mode (closes: #372618).
    - Fixes compiler warnings and errors (closes: #373802, #356153, #369779).
    - Fix byte swapping issues (closes: #369765).
    - Now lists devices it stops (closes: #369850). This also leads to
      beautification of the init.d script's stop action.
  * Fixed RAID init script to not complain about missing logger command.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Jun 2006 00:58:36 +0200

mdadm (2.5-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "would you like fries with your parasite?" release.
  * Now does not require RAID support from the kernel just for package
    installation; that was silly of me, sorry (closes: Bug#370115).
  * Added version to Replaces: initramfs-tools dependency.
  * Further init.d script improvements.
  * Recommends mail-transport-agent, or the monitor daemon won't be able to
    send anything.
  * Ignores failures from modprobe in postinst when RAID modules are not
    available (closes: #370582).

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Jun 2006 12:45:53 +0200

mdadm (2.5-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added /usr/share/doc/mdadm/README.recipes with some common usage examples.
  * Vastly improved the mdadm-raid init.d script output, and removed bashisms.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Jun 2006 00:45:06 +0200

mdadm (2.5-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "on her majesty's secret service" release.
  * Enabled -DDEBIAN during build, which will take care of default permissions
    on devices created by mdadm. Together with the CREATE configuration
    directive in 2.5, this now certainly closes: Bug#310241.
  * Added a patch (incorporating lib/mm/xlate.h from lvm2) to prevent direct
    access to kernel headers from userspace (closes: Bug#369765).
  * Disabled strict aliasing compiler checks until we find a better
    implementation for linked lists in C (closes: Bug#369779, Bug#356153).
  * Actually decreased the size of the udeb mdadm binary with -Os
    -fomit-frame-pointer (as suggested by Joey Hess) (closes: Bug#314370)
  * Added Replaces: initramfs-tools to communicate that we're not conflicting
    but replacing instead (see Bug#367567)
  * Updated conflict with initramfs-tools to (<< 0.63) per suggestion by the
    maintainers.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jun 2006 20:15:17 +0200

mdadm (2.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "show me the way to the next whiskey bar" release.
  * See /usr/share/doc/mdadm/README.experimental or
    http://madduck.net/~madduck/scratch/README.experimental
  * New upstream release:
    - mails include /proc/mdstat output (closes: Bug#355882)
    - allows specification of device permissions in config (closes: Bug#310241)
  * /sbin/mdrun has been deprecated and replaced by calls to /sbin/mdadm;
    a proper deprecation warning is in place (see NEWS).
  * Moved initramfs hook and script into the package, and switched it to mdadm
    (from mdadm. Thanks to Stephen Frost for his help (closes: Bug#354144).
    This should make sure that the right minor numbers are chosen during boot
    (mainly because mdadm takes care of it all) (closes: Bug#361408).
  * Removing mdrun from the udeb (d-i patch submitted to debian-boot mailing
    list)
  * Upstream links against openssl for SHA1 support (homehost feature), which
    is a problem. An internal SHA1 implementation is provided, however, so
    I just link against that.
  * Switched init.d scripts to use LSB-compliant output.
  * Enhanced init.d script output.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jun 2006 02:20:22 +0200

mdadm (2.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "this took way longer than I thought" release.
  * Migrating to unstable.
  * If the init.d script creates the mdadm.conf file, it should remove it on
    purge. To accomplish this, I create a semaphore in /var/lib/mdadm if it
    was generated, and only remove the conffile on purge if the semaphore
    exists.
  * Added a little helper /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf to aid generation of
    configuration file.
  * Added a bug script to collect some important information when the user
    uses Debian bug reporting tools (such as reportbug).
  * Added a debian/watch file.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Wed, 31 May 2006 23:07:48 +0200

mdadm (2.4.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "I'll kill that maintainer... uh, wait, it's me" release. Sorry for
    the delay, here's the long awaited new upstream release (closes:
    Bug#337903, Bug#363592), which gets rid of a bunch of functionality bugs:
    - reiserfs size does not overflow anymore (closes: Bug#318230)
    - fixed typos in manpages (closes: Bug#352798)
    Oh, and we're moving away from that arch nightmare too. Sorry for the
    confusion.
  * Experimental release, because I really don't want to be responsible for
    data loss. Though I am quite sure that the upgrade is painless, I also
    don't have access to 18 drive RAID 10 with multipath on s390 or similar
    arrangements.
  * We now make the /dev/md* devices in postinst unless /dev/md15 exists (no
    longer checking for /dev/md0), or unless devfs is in use. If udev is used,
    /dev/md15 will only exist in complex setups, so the devices will be made
    in /dev/.static by MAKEDEV, which is not really a concern. I opted against
    unconditionally calling MAKEDEV until #367407 is fixed so as to preserve
    custom permissions or owner settings. This also acknowledges the NMU
    (#299623).
    closes: Bug#310247, Bug#299623
  * Patched some of the code to make mdadm honour /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf over
    /etc/mdadm.conf (see NEWS).
  * Fixed a couple of typos in the mdadm(8) manpage; thanks to Reuben Thomas.
    closes: Bug#345669, Bug#345667
  * Pushed Standards-Version to 3.7.2; no changes required.
  * Updated Debconf translations:
    - Vietnamese by Clytie Siddall (closes: Bug#323950)
    - Czech by Miroslav Kure (closes: Bug#360290)
    - Russian by Yuri Kozlov (closes: Bug#361116)
    - French by Eric Madesclair (closes: Bug#323988)
  * Added new Debconf translations:

    - Acknowledge NMU by Steve Langasek; thanks! (closes: Bug#299623)
    - split diff.gz into different arch branches (see debian/arch-branches).
    - debian/control:

      - Added Czech debconf translation; thanks to Miroslav Kure! (closes: Bug#319626)
      - Updated German debconf translation; thanks to Jens Seidel! (closes: Bug#313981)
    - backported upstream's gcc4 signedness fixes from 1.12.0 (gcc4signedness

mdadm (1.9.0-4.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * High-urgency upload for sarge-targetted RC bugfix
  * Make sure error output from MAKEDEV is sent to stderr, to avoid
    interfering with debconf; this avoids installation problems on
    udev-using systems.  Thanks to Jonas Smedegaard for the patch.
    Closes: #299623.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Wed, 25 May 2005 09:51:41 +0200

mdadm (1.9.0-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * High-urgency upload for sarge targeted RC bugfix.
  * Applied patch by Peter Samuelson <peter@p12n.org>, which causes mdadm to
    follow symlinks of device nodes (closes: #274859, #310412, #310492).
  * Added myself as co-maintainer as per agreement with Mario Joussen.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Tue, 24 May 2005 00:03:49 +0200

mdadm (1.9.0-2.3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Do not prevent postinst node creation when udev is being used; MAKEDEV
    puts files into /dev/.static/dev with udev, which is needed so that device
    nodes will be there even if udev is removed. Sorry for letting this slip
    my mind and thanks to Steve Langasek for spotting this error.
  * Leaving urgency at high to make sarge.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Sun, 22 May 2005 19:35:04 +0200

mdadm (1.9.0-2.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * High-urgency upload for sarge targeted RC bugfix.
  * Move mdadm-raid back to S25 as it needs to run after modules have been
    loaded at S20 (see followups to #294404, #301560).
  * Verified that Steve Langasek's patch to config.c (see item 4 of the
    1.9.0-2.1 changelog) is necessary for `mdadm -A -s` to work.
    (closes: #301560)
  * Integrated patch by Erik van Konijnenburg to fix mdadm's --auto
    option in the presence of --scan.
    (closes: #294404, #273182, #284028, #310126).
  * Modified mdrun to call mdadm with --auto in assembly mode. Removed code
    which would auto-create 24 device nodes during system startup when udev
    was used.
  * Fixed next_free_md function in mdrun to iterate all 24 nodes instead of
    using some fragile shell globbing, which did not work anyway.
  * Prevent postinst node creation when udev is being used.
  * Added a README.udev file to /usr/share/doc/mdadm.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Sun, 22 May 2005 12:57:56 +0200

mdadm (1.9.0-2.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * High-urgency upload for sarge targetted RC bugfix.
  * Start mdadm-raid before udev on boot-up, so that mdadm device node
    creation is honored, and support changing the init script ordering
    on upgrades (closes: #294404).
  * Fix mdadm --scan to prefer the values contained in /proc/partitions,
    instead of picking up device node names at random from /dev.
  * Teach mdrun to look at /dev/.static/dev instead of /.dev for udev
    mounts requiring autostart (closes: #301560).
