upgrading to mdadm 2.5.3 from previous versions
===============================================

With version 2.5.3, the Debian mdadm package now requires a mdadm.conf file.
This file should be in /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf, although /etc/mdadm.conf will
also be read if the former is not present, but it is less preferred.

The reason the configuration file is now required is because it was impossible
to come up with robust heuristics to replace the previously used mdrun, while
addressing its primary deficiency of not honouring the super-minor field and
randomly assembling devices (see #354705).

Systems without a mdadm.conf file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If your system does not have an mdadm.conf file, the package creates one for
your during the installation phase. Furthermore, a configuration file is
created during the updating of the initramfs (initial ramdisk), if no file is
found at the time. In both cases, the running system is used as a reference,
meaning that the file is generated automatically in such a way as to reflect
the running system.

This should work in most cases. I strongly suggest, however, that you inspect
the generated file (/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf) before you reboot. If you find any
anomaly or mistakes, correct them and proceed with the next step ("Systems
with a mdadm.conf file").
