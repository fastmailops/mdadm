Testing new version of mdadm
============================

The easiest way to test new mdadm packages is by adding my package repository
(i386/amd64) to your sources.list file, and configuring the APT pins
appropriately:

---8<---
# cat <<_eof >> /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://debian.madduck.net/repo sid main
_eof
# cat <<_eof >> /etc/apt/preferences
Package: *
Pin: release a=sid, release o=madduck
Pin-Priority: 50

Package: mdadm
Pin: release a=sid, release o=madduck
Pin-Priority: 600
_eof
# apt-get update; apt-get upgrade
---8<---

Alternatively, you can just download the package for i386[0] or amd64[1]:

  0. http://debian.madduck.net/repo/dists/sid/main/binary-i386/admin/
  1. http://debian.madduck.net/repo/dists/sid/main/binary-amd64/admin/

If you're running sarge and are willing to test, that would be great! I've
prepared backports, which you can use like so (note how you need backported
debconf and lsb-base packages too, which are to be found in the backports.org
archive [2]; see also further down for direct links):

  2. http://backports.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=instructions

---8<---
# cat <<_eof >> /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://debian.madduck.net/repo sarge-backports main
## unless you have backports already enabled:
deb http://www.backports.org/debian sarge-backports main
_eof
# cat <<_eof >> /etc/apt/preferences
Package: *
Pin: release a=sarge-backports, release o=madduck
Pin-Priority: 50

Package: mdadm
Pin: release a=sarge-backports, release o=madduck
Pin-Priority: 600

Package: debconf
Pin: release a=sarge-backports
Pin-Priority: 600

Package: lsb-base
Pin: release a=sarge-backports
Pin-Priority: 600
_eof
# apt-get update; apt-get upgrade
---8<---

The mdadm backport can also be directly downloaded for i386[3] or amd64[4], the
needed debconf[5] and lsb-base[6] reside in the backports.org archive.

  3. http://debian.madduck.net/repo/dists/sarge-backports/main/binary-i386/admin/
  4. http://debian.madduck.net/repo/dists/sarge-backports/main/binary-amd64/admin/
  5. http://backports.org/debian/pool/main/d/debconf/
  6. http://backports.org/debian/pool/main/l/lsb/

Much appreciated!
