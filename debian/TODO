debian mdadm TODO list
======================

- check whether mdadm.conf and system are consistent during initramfs creation
  and fail otherwise (#381303).
- then switch to using system mdadm.conf in initramfs.
- add debconf question to determine naming scheme. Reuse logic from udev
  script mdadm-name-generator.sh to preseed the question, store answer in
  /etc/default, make mdadm-name-generator.sh actually use that value. Or just
  get rid of mdadm-name-generator.sh and move everything to debconf.config,
  then install udev rules for each naming scheme to /usr/share/mdadm and use
  ucf to install the appropriate one to /etc.
