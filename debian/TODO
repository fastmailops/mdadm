debian mdadm TODO list
======================

- check whether mdadm.conf and system are consistent during initramfs creation
  and fail otherwise (#381303).
- version-1 is a nightmare. E.g. on partitionable arrays, with / on
  /dev/md_d0p3, mdadm -Es ignores /dev/md_d0 and just uses the name, so
  /dev/md/<arrayname>.
- figure out something about device names.

- add code to compare existing and expected configuration, after standardising
  the files. In most cases, we'll have to answer DUNNO as to whether the
  existing configuration file is okay, but I guess in some cases we can
  determine that the configuration is okay. A conservative approach would be
  beneficial to the user. Not sure if it's worth the effort though.

- VERIFY SARGE UPGRADE
- verify operation without udev
  - udev removed before mdadm installed
  - udev removed after mdadm installed
