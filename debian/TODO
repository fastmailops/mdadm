debian mdadm TODO list
======================

- check whether mdadm.conf and system are consistent during initramfs creation
  and fail otherwise (#381303).
- version-1 is a nightmare. E.g. on partitionable arrays, with / on
  /dev/md_d0p3, mdadm -Es ignores /dev/md_d0 and just uses the name, so
  /dev/md/<arrayname>.
- figure out something about device names.

- VERIFY SARGE UPGRADE
- verify operation without udev
  - udev removed before mdadm installed
  - udev removed after mdadm installed
