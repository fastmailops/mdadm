"WARNING! If you are using hard disks which have RAID superblocks from "
"earlier installations in different RAID arrays, you MUST zero each "
"superblock *before* activating the autostart feature."
msgstr ""

#. Type: note

#: ../mdadm.templates:1001

"To do this, do not start the RAID devices automatically. First, zero the "
"superblock (mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/mdX). Next, use `dpkg-reconfigure "
"mdadm` to reactivate the autostart feature."

"If you manage your RAIDs otherwise (e.g. EVMS), either disable autostart, or "
"ensure that /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf only lists those arrays you want to start "
"by mdadm."

msgid "RAID arrays needed for the root filesystem:"
msgstr ""

#. Type: string
#. Description
#: ../mdadm.templates:2001
msgid ""
"If your system has its root filesystem on a RAID volume, it needs to be "
"started early during the boot sequence. If your root filesystem is on a "
"logical volume (LVM), which is on RAID, all constituent arrays need to be "
"started."

msgid ""
"If you know exactly which arrays are needed to bring up the root filesystem, "
"enter them here. Alternatively, enter 'all' to simply start all available "
"arrays. If you do not need or want to start any arrays for the root "
"filesystem, leave the answer blank (or enter 'none')."
msgstr ""

#. Type: string
#. Description
#: ../mdadm.templates:2001
msgid ""
"You have the option to start all other arrays (those not needed for the root "
"filesystem) later in the boot sequence. Doing so will give you greater "
"control over the arrays with the mdadm configuration file. Starting all "
"arrays at boot-time may be safer though."

msgid ""
"Once the base system has come up, mdadm can start all RAID devices specified "
"in /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf, which have not yet been started. Unless you have "
"compiled RAID support into the kernel (in which case all RAID arrays with "
"partitions of type 0xfd (and only those) are started automatically anyway), "

#. Type: boolean
#. Description
#: ../mdadm.templates:4001
msgid ""
"If your kernel supports it (>> 2.6.14), mdadm can periodically check the "
"redundancy of your RAID devices. This may be a resource-intensive process, "
"depending on your setup, but it could help prevent rare cases of data loss. "
"Note that this is a read-only check unless errors are found; if errors are "
"found, mdadm will try to correct them, which may result in write access to "
"the media."
